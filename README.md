# Fuzzy_Inference
Task 2 from the exam - Algorithm Heuristics

In this task, I created two fuzzy inference systems, type 1 and type 2 and tested their output with a given simulink model. Documentation is in Serbian and explains the flow of the task. For type 2 i used a free software created by A. Taskin, you can find it on the internet, my professor provided it, but i do not want to 
post it here to swap the usefull files and information.
